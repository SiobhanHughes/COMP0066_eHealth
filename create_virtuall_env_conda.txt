1. Cheak conda is up to date: conda update conda
2. Create virtual environment for the project: conda create -n yourenvname python=x.x anaconda
3. Acivate virtual environment: conda activate yourenvname (if not using conda - source activate)


Activating a conda environment modifies the PATH and shell variables to point to the specific isolated Python 
set-up you created. The command prompt will change to indicate which conda environemnt you are currently in by 
prepending (yourenvname). To see a list of all your environments, use the command conda info -e.

4. Install additional Python packages to a virtual environment: conda install -n yourenvname [package]
5. Deactivate virtual environment: conda deactivate (source deactivate)
6. Delete no longer needed virtual environment: conda remove -n yourenvname -all
