2. Admin table in eHealth database: this table conatins 2 columns (administrator, passwd) which has the default settings 'admin', 'admin' already saved in the database. This table is used to store the administrator username (admin) and password (admin). When admin first logs in using the password 'admin', the system will ask the admin to change the password to a more secure one. The admin will log in using the username 'admin' and the chosen password from then on.
